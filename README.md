# Ukraine DAO project ideas

[Atom feed](https://ukraine-dao.github.io/project-ideas/feed/projects.xml)

Ideas for projects that Ukraine DAO currently has no resources to work on.

If you have any other ideas - jump into `dev-chat` channel on our
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/fQzVbh2FWS) to discuss them.

## List of ideas

* [Twitter reporting helper](_projects/twitter_reporting_extension.md)

## Implementation requirements

Pretty much the only requirement is to use MIT/BSD-style license. You don't have
to transfer IP rights to Ukraine DAO.

If the project is something that should run on a server, we'd prefer for it to
support [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine), that way we can
host it for free for light loads. Feel free to discuss with us whether that's a
viable option for the particular project.

## Process

If you'd like to start working on of the projects, the first thing to do is to
let us know about it :) Please jump into [`dev-chat`](https://discord.gg/fQzVbh2FWS)
and say that you want to start the work.

### Code location

Please transfer your repository to [@Ukraine-DAO](https://github.com/Ukraine-DAO)
organization or ask someone in `dev-chat` to create one for you there. That way
people who also want to help us can easily find your repository.

You will be granted ["Maintain" access level](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization) to that repository.

### Deployment/publication

In most cases one of Ukraine DAO members will be deploying your software. On one
hand it gives us control over what we're using or endorsing, on the other -
removes the burden of deployment from you.

### Communication

Feel free to ask questions in [`dev-chat`](https://discord.gg/fQzVbh2FWS). If
you would like a code review, send a pull request and ask to have it reviewed
in [`dev-chat`](https://discord.gg/fQzVbh2FWS).
